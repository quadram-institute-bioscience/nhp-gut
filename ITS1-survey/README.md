* Study ID: **PRJEB54860**

_Macaca fascicularis_ is a non-human primate widely used in biomedical researchas its genetics and physiology are similar to those of humans. In this study we elucidated the composition of the prokaryome and mycobiome components of the intestinal microbiota, with a region-by-region taxonomic survey from duodenum to distal colon.
